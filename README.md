# TriviaGame

This project is a Trivia Game

This front-end application the uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. This project highlights using a countdown timer.

The game works as follows:

* When the player presses Start - it starts the game and the timer 

* When the game starts the page loads with multiple choice trivia questions
(These are radio buttons and can only choose one)

* The player attempts to answer as many trivia questions as possible while the timer counts down

* When the timer hits zero, OR the player hits the “Done” button, the game counts:
  * The number of correct answers the player guessed
  * The number of incorrect answers the player guessed
  * The number of unanswered questions the player didn’t get to
