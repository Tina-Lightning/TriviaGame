# TriviaGame

This project is a Real Housewives Trivia Game

This front-end application the uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. This project highlights using a countdown timer.

The game works as follows:

* When the player presses Start - it starts the game 

* The game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a message appears telling them whether they got it right or not. After a few seconds, the next question is displyed. 

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
